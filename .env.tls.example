# ========================================
# DSP Platform TLS Configuration Example
# ========================================
# Copy this file to .env and configure as needed

# ===== TLS/HTTPS Configuration =====
# Enable TLS encryption for all communications
# - HTTPS for Web Console (port 441)
# - TLS for Agent communication (port 447)
TLS_ENABLED=true

# Certificate paths (for Master Server)
# These are used for both HTTPS and Agent TLS listener
TLS_CERT_PATH=./certs/server.crt
TLS_KEY_PATH=./certs/server.key

# CA Certificate path (for Agent to verify Master Server)
TLS_CA_PATH=./certs/ca.crt

# Skip certificate verification (DEVELOPMENT ONLY!)
# Set to true only for testing with self-signed certificates
# In production, this should ALWAYS be false
TLS_SKIP_VERIFY=false

# ========================================
# Quick Setup Guide:
# ========================================
#
# 1. Generate certificates (Windows):
#    .\deployment\certs\generate-certs.ps1
#
# 2. Generate certificates (Linux):
#    ./deployment/certs/generate-certs.sh
#
# 3. Or let the application auto-generate:
#    Set TLS_ENABLED=true and start the Master Server
#    It will auto-generate self-signed certificates if not found
#
# 4. Distribute ca.crt to all Agent machines
#    Agents need the CA certificate to verify the Master Server
#
# ========================================
# Rollback to Non-TLS:
# ========================================
# Simply set TLS_ENABLED=false and restart services
# No code changes required
# ========================================
